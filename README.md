Abstract
The MDNA Resonance Engine is an interactive, steampunk-themed web application that provides a hands-on method for analyzing quantitative data using the Multi-Domain Numerical Amplification (MDNA) framework. Based on the principles outlined in the paper "MDNA: Extreme Value Differentiation via Exponential Inversion," this tool allows users to visually and dynamically tune parameters to find the optimal analytical frequency for various scientific datasets.
The engine transforms the mathematical process into a tactile experience, simulating the operation of a vintage scientific instrument to provide a more intuitive understanding of the data's resonance and prediction error.
The Core Formula
The engine's calculations are based on the principle of exponential inversion to amplify and differentiate subtle variations in data. The core formula is:
The final logarithmic result displayed by the oscilloscope is calculated as:
Where:
 * V_0: The reference value for a given domain.
 * V: The measured value of the entity being analyzed.
 * k: The exponent, which controls the sensitivity of the amplification. This is the value tuned by the "K Resonator" knob.
Features
 * Interactive Steampunk Interface: A unique, old-fashioned design with brass panels, glowing vacuum tubes, and tactile controls.
 * Real-Time 'k' Value Tuning: Use the "K Resonator" knob to adjust the k exponent and see its effect on the analysis in real-time.
 * Live Oscilloscope Wave Graph: The main display visualizes the MDNA result as a wave. The wave's stability and noise level are directly tied to the prediction error.
 * Frequency Resonance Gauge: An analog meter that provides instant feedback on how close the current k value is to the optimal frequency for the selected domain.
 * Multi-Domain Analysis: Comes pre-loaded with datasets from Planetary Science, Seismology, Biology, and Cometary studies.
 * Detailed Data Display: Shows key metrics for each entity, including mass, diameter, and velocity, alongside the real-time prediction error.
